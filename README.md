# Hate speech detection
This project is based on the paper ["Deep Learning for Hate Speech Detection in Tweets"](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3041021.3054223)
and for our research we 'll be using the [dataset](https://github.com/zeerakw/hatespeech)
that the authors of the paper ["Hateful Symbols or Hateful People? Predictive Features for Hate Speech Detection on Twitter"](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/N16-2013/)
had used.

In this research, we will try to expand the knowledge that the previous authors had acquired 
and we will attempt to follow a new approach. Specifically, we will try to detect hate speech in
tweets, analyzing the user's profile using any metrics we may find useful. Therefore, we move
from NLP analysis to Social Network analysis.
